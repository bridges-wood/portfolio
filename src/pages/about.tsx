			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
				From starting programming in Python on a Raspberry Pi when I was 12,
				I've taught myself virtually everything that I know through doing. At
				the beginning, that was creating a program that constructed a house in
				Minecraft, eventually leading to my most recent project: this site.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site is meant to be a showcase of everything that I have learned up
				to the point that you're reading this, and I will continually be
				expanding it with new features and content. Every project that makes its
				way to my Github will be here and I am excited to flesh out my
				development portfolio with new and exciting projects.
			</p>
			<h3>Planned future projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Microservices</li>
				<li>Cloud computing</li>
				<li>ML</li>
				<li>Unreal Engine game development</li>
				<li>Natural Language processing</li>
