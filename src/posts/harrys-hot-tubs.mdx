As my very first freelance web development project, I created a website for a local
hot tub company. Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/),
and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), it manages the whole hot tub booking process
for customers as well as the buisness, with a dashboard for delivery drivers and
managers that allow them to track the status and availability of all their hot tubs.
