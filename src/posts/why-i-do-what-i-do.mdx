## Captialism

I've always liked Capitalism on the whole; it's a system that likes to make you feel like everything is fair. Those who provide the greatest value to society will be rewarded proportionately. It's a system that likes to make you feel like you can do anything you want, and that you can be anything you want. It's a system that likes to make you feel like you can be successful if you just work hard enough. It's a system that likes to make you feel like you can be rich if you just work hard enough. It's a system that likes to make you feel like you can be happy if you just work hard enough.

A lot of my friends and family have been very successful in this system. They've worked hard, and they've been rewarded. They've worked hard, and they've been happy. They've worked hard, and they've been rich. They've worked hard, and they've been successful. They've worked hard, and they've been able to do anything they want. 

Personally, I think that the rewards society imparts on an individual, monetary or otherwise, are a just reflection of the work they put in. A lot of those rewards, like a high salary, are the results of years of work - we've all heard stories of the suffering genius working for years before their work is recognised. 

## Delayed Gratification
> Delayed gratification is the ability to forgo an immediate reward in order to receive a larger reward at a later date.

In 1970, researchers Walter Mischel and Ebbe B. Ebbesen conducted a now famous experiment on delayed gratification at Stanford University. 32 children (16 boys and 16 girls) were placed into a room devoid of distractions, with a treat placed on table. The researchers let the children know that they could eat the treat, but if they waited 15 minutes without giving in to temptation, they would be rewarded with a second treat. This became known as the **Stanford Marshmallow Experiment**.

In follow-up studies, the researchers found that the children who were able to delay gratification were more likely to succeed in life. They were more likely to have higher SAT scores, improved reaction times, and better health. They were also less likely to be obese, have drug problems, or be involved in criminal activity. Even in studies designed to test the predictive power of the "marshmallow test", the results were consistent: the ability to delay gratification was a strong predictor of success.

Since I learned about the experiment at the start of high school, I internalised the idea that delayed gratification was the key to success. I was determined to maximise my future success, by avoiding the temptation of immediate gratification. I was going to be the best version of myself, and I was going to do it by delaying gratification.
